## 🧭 Introduction
  This blog aims to help future students by sharing every document and experience.

---
## Research
Before everything, while you are doing your bachelor's, try to do some research work. It will be very helpful. [for PhD and MS]

## 📊 Standardized Tests

### GRE
- Though the GRE is not mandatory for most of the programs, it is always a plus to have. If you are going for an Engineering or related field, then the Quant section of the GRE will be very helpful. Try to keep the Quant score at least 160 if you are going to an engineering-related subject.

### TOEFL / IELTS
- You must have these tests ready for applying to the university [Exception is not an example]. You should try to keep a minimum TOEFL score of 190 or a minimum IELTS score of 6.5. There are some other English tests, but it is recommended to take TOEFL or IELTS.

---

## ✍️ Application Documents
Now it is time to make some documents ready to apply centrally, and also to email the professor.
### Statement of Purpose (SOP)
- It should be within 2 pages   
- [📄 View My SOP Example](#my-sop-sample)

### Letters of Recommendation (LOR)
- Try to take LOR from the Professor with whom you have worked and have at least 1 collaborative paper work    
- [📄 LOR Example](#my-lor-sample)

### Resume/CV
- Format and key points for PhD application
- [📄 View My CV Example](#my-CV-sample)

#### Now that everything is ready, you should start the next two steps in parallel. First, select some universities and apply through their central application systems. Second, search for professors who are currently accepting students. You should email professors not only from the universities you’ve applied to but also from any other institutions where you find suitable research matches. If a professor shows interest in your profile and you haven’t yet applied to that university, you can then submit your application there.

## 🏫 University Selection

### How I Shortlisted Universities
- This data helped me analyze which universities align best with my profile; https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RpWaU1AQjgTd1jzBYhw8lk-NNORSPaFC-lWdaS8VvvU/edit?gid=720774269#gid=720774269 
- If you look at the posts in this group, you’ll get an idea of the profiles of students who are getting admission;  https://www.facebook.com/groups/nextop.usa
- You might have a favorite state because a relative lives there, or you might choose a state based on its weather.
- Now, as you have all the information you can select which university you want to apply.

### Comparing CS vs CE Admission Difficulty
- Computer Science is usually harder to get into than Computer Engineering, even though both programs are rigorous and share many courses in the early years.  

---

## 💌 Emailing Professors
You can find Professors who will take new students from this group- https://www.facebook.com/groups/nextop.usa
You can also create your LinkedIn profile and be connected with many academic people, this you will also see post where professor are looking for students. This will save a lot of your time.
### How to Write an Effective Email
- Read some of the professor’s papers from Google Scholar. You can use https://notebooklm.google/ to summarize and understand them easily. This tool really helped me grasp research papers and write emails with much less effort.

### Sample Emails I Sent
- [📄 Sample 1 – Research Inquiry](#)
- [📄 Sample 2 – Follow-up Email](#)

### Tips
- If you have a professional or paid email address that includes your real name, use that. For example, I used my work email when I was employed as a software engineer.
- Keep your email short and to the point — professors usually don’t have much time to read long messages.
- Show genuine interest in their research and explain why you’re reaching out.
- Keep all attached document names consistent, such as DocumentName_MahediKamal.

## 🎓 Getting Offers

### RA / TA / Fellowship Funding
- If you get an admission letter but didn't get funding then reach out to the department and professors.
- My experience getting RA: I applied centrally and received an admission offer for Fall 2025, but didn't get any funding then. So, I deferred my admission to Fall 2026. Later, I emailed a professor from that university, and he expressed interest in having me join in Spring 2026. As a result, I changed my admission term again and received a Research Assistantship (RA) offer from that professor.
- If you have got any offer from a professor via email but don’t yet have an admission offer from that university, you should apply quickly. The professor can then support your application and help you secure funding.

## 💰 I-20 and Financial Documents

- After you have managed your Admission and funding now it is time to get you I-20
- For my case, I have to email Director of Recruitment & Marketing to get the I-20 

### Common I-20 Issues and Fixes
- If you are fully funded but your I-20 shows a small deficit (e.g., $1–2k), that’s usually okay. You can simply show a bank statement covering that amount.
- If your funding letter only covers one term but mentions that it will be renewed for the next term, that’s also acceptable. Again, just show the deficit amount with a bank statement.
- However, if you are not fully funded (e.g., only 80% funding), you will need a very strong bank statement. Otherwise, there is a high risk of visa denial.
